# HyperBattle

This is a JavaScript implementation of a two-player fighting game using a canvas. The game includes two players, each with their own set of attacks, and event listeners to respond to keyboard inputs.

## Game Rules

The goal of the game is to defeat the opponent by reducing their health to zero. Each player has a set of attacks that can be triggered by pressing specific keys on the keyboard. The game includes a health bar for each player to keep track of their remaining health. The game ends when one player's health is reduced to zero.

## Getting Started
